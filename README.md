## Introduction:

Global poverty is one of the most pressing challenges we face today. The poorest individuals around the world lack access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, and education. Understanding poverty trends and patterns is crucial for addressing this issue effectively.

This repository contains researced data, visualizations, and other documentations related to poverty. A breakdown of the project includes project structure, workflow and resources to provide insights on collaboration. The goal is to provide useful data to manage projects for future users and how data can be used to provide solutions for tackling poverty issue. <br><br/>

## 🖥 Project Brief


Our project aims to conduct a comparative data analysis of global poverty focusing on the intricate relationship between poverty, education and corruption factors. The primary objective is to unravel the complex interplay of these elements through data visualisation to inform targeted interventions and policies aimed at poverty alleviation.

## 💡  Data Insights

Key Insights: 


Measuring Poverty: Different countries use varying poverty lines to define who is considered poor. For instance, while the United States sets a poverty line at roughly $24.55 per day, Ethiopia’s poverty line is set at just $2.04 per day. To measure global poverty consistently, we use the International Poverty Line of $2.15 per day,
established by the World Bank and the UN.

Decline in Extreme Poverty:

Over the last generation, global extreme poverty has significantly decreased. However, millions still live in extreme poverty, especially in low-income countries.

Challenges Ahead: 

Despite progress, hundreds of millions remain in extreme poverty. Addressing this requires continued efforts and innovative solutions.

## Data Sources:

Our data relies on national household surveys, which may differ across countries and over time.
The International Poverty Line of $2.15 per day serves as a consistent threshold for extreme poverty worldwide.
