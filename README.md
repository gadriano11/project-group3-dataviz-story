## Introduction:

Addressing global poverty requires a comprehensive approach, as it stands among the foremost challenges of our time. Individuals in the most impoverished corners of the world often grapple with the absence of fundamental necessities like food, clean water, and education. A nuanced comprehension of poverty's intricate trends and patterns is essential for formulating effective solutions to this pressing issue.

This repository contains researced data, visualizations, and other documentations related to EDA of global poverty. Breakdown of the project includes project structure, workflow, data analysis and resources to provide insights on collaboration work and result of the project. The objective is to furnish valuable data to guide future project management, illustrating how this data can serve as a pivotal tool in devising impactful solutions for combating the issue of poverty.. <br><br/>

## üñ• Project Brief

Our project aims to conduct a comparative data analysis of global poverty focusing on the differences within individual countries and their relationship between poverty, education and corruption factors. The primary objective is to unravel the complex interplay of these elements through data visualisation to inform targeted interventions and policies aimed at poverty alleviation.

## üí° Data Insights

Objectively, to compile the data and generate a report, we used the following measurements to assist in determining the correlation between poverty, corruption and education among individual countries.

`1 -  CORRUPTION INDEX `<br>
<ul> 
In September 2022, the figure at which this poverty line is set shifted from $1.90 to $2.15.
The international poverty line is the threshold below which a person is considered to be living in poverty. It is often expressed as a monetary value per day, and one commonly used threshold is $2.15 per day. This means that individuals living on less than $2.15 per day are considered to be living in extreme poverty.<br>

`2  -  International Poverty Line < $2.15 per day `<br>
<ul>
</ul>

`3  -  Female and Male Gross Education Enrollment `<br>
